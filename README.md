# idea-book

I love Side Projects. I learn through Side Projects. I [gave a presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/zachleat/side-projects) on why I think Side Projects are important.

An important part of brainstorming ideas for Side Projects is to have an Idea Book. I’ve decided to make my Idea Book public. Ideas are logged as [issues (sorted by 👍)](https://github.com/zachleat/idea-book/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). This is simply a dump of ideas for Side Projects that I’m putting out here for public feedback. I welcome your comments and votes 👍 or 👎 on project ideas.
